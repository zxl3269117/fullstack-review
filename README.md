This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on by myself.

In this project, I built a github fetcher that fetch and displays the top 25 repo by number of watches on the repo. Information related to the repo such as published time, watch number, description and more are displayed if available.
